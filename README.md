# HTML Foundations Project: Recipes

This is my repository from The Odin Project's HTML Foundations Project: Recipes.

This project showcases the creation of HTML boilerplate, use of headers, paragraphs, images, and list. It also contains usage of absolute and relative links to pages as well as to the sources of images.

It is good practice for creating GitHub repositories, and publish the web projects there.

This project also allowed for lots of practice using Git to clone, add, commit, and push changes to a repository.
