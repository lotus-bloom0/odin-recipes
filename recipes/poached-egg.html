  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    For those who like a nice, runny egg. There is truly nothing like it, and while many people are familiar with the concept of making eggs over-easy.

  </p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
    <li>egg (barely plural), fresh as possible</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Directions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Fill a large sauce pan with 2 to 3 inches of water, and bring to boil over high heat.</li>
    <li>Reduce the heat to a low simmer, adding the distilled vinegar and salt.</li>
    <li>Break each egg into a small ramekin; and with the ramekin close to the water's surface, gently pour the egg in. <em>Note:</em> You can sir the water and create a vortex in the pan then you can drop the egg into the center, and it will help keep the egg white and yolk together.</li>
    <li>Allow to cook for 2&frac12; - 4 minutes allowing the whites to set, and yolks to thicken. Remove with a slotted spoon and dab on a paper towel to remove excess water.</li>
    <li>Add black pepper and salt to taste.</li>
  </ol>

  <p>Enjoy! Remember, practice makes perfect.</p>
